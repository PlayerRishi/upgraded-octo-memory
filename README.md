# üåê PiCraft Plugin

A lightweight, zero-bloat Paper/Spigot plugin for PiCraft Season 2 that adds a clean player report system, simple staff tools, and a /rules command that reads from a separate rules.txt file. Plays nice with LuckPerms, CoreProtect, and DiscordSRV.

5. **Optional**: Install DiscordSRV for Discord integration
6. **Permissions**: Set up permissions with LuckPerms or your permission plugin
7. **Reload**: Use `/reload confirm` or restart the server

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The plugin generates a `config.yml` with these sections:

### Storage
```yaml
storage:
  type: sqlite      # Currently only SQLite supported
```

### Cooldowns
```yaml
cooldowns:
  report: 30        # Seconds between reports
```

### Notifications
```yaml
notifications:
  on_staff_join: true    # Notify staff of unread reports on join
  unread_count: true     # Show unread count
```

### Discord Integration
```yaml
discord:
  enabled: false                    # Requires DiscordSRV
  channel_id: ""                   # Discord channel ID
  ping_role_id: ""                 # Optional role to mention
  message: "**New report #{id}**..." # Message template
```

### Rules System
```yaml
rules:
  file: "rules.txt"               # Rules file name
  pagination:
    enabled: false                # Enable pagination
    lines_per_page: 12           # Lines per page
```

### Messages
All messages are customizable with color codes (`&` format).

## üóÉÔ∏è How It Works

### Database Structure
The plugin uses SQLite to store reports with these fields:
- `id` - Auto-incrementing report ID
- `created_at` - Timestamp when report was created
- `reporter_uuid` - UUID of the reporter
- `reporter_name` - Name of the reporter
- `anonymous` - Whether the report is anonymous
- `category` - Optional category (griefing, hacking, etc.)
- `message` - The report message
- `world`, `x`, `y`, `z` - Location where report was filed
- `status` - OPEN, READ, or CLOSED
- `assigned_to` - Staff member assigned to the report

### Report Flow
1. **Player reports**: `/report griefing Someone broke my chest`
2. **System saves**: Report stored in database with location
3. **Staff notified**: Online staff get notification
4. **Discord ping**: Optional Discord message sent
5. **Staff manages**: View, read, assign, and close reports
6. **Teleport**: Staff can teleport to report location

### Anonymous Reports
- Anonymous reports hide the reporter's name from normal staff
- Only staff with `picraft.report.view.realname` can see the real reporter
- Useful for sensitive reports where players fear retaliation

## üîß Code Structure Explained

### Main Components

1. **PiCraftPlugin.java** - Main plugin class that initializes everything
2. **Report.java** - Data model representing a report
3. **DatabaseManager.java** - Handles SQLite database operations
4. **ConfigManager.java** - Manages configuration settings
5. **ReportManager.java** - Handles notifications and Discord integration
6. **Command Classes** - Handle all command execution
7. **PlayerJoinListener.java** - Notifies staff on join

### Key Design Decisions

- **SQLite over MySQL**: No external database required, perfect for small servers
- **Permission-based**: Integrates with existing permission systems
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only requires Paper/Spigot API and SQLite
- **Modular design**: Each component has a specific responsibility
- **Configuration-driven**: Most behavior can be customized via config

### Database Operations

The `DatabaseManager` class handles all database operations:
- **Connection management**: Opens/closes SQLite connection
- **Table creation**: Creates tables on first run
- **CRUD operations**: Create, read, update reports
- **Filtering**: Get reports by status, pagination support
- **Statistics**: Count unread reports for notifications

### Command System

Commands are organized into logical groups:
- **ReportCommand**: Handles player report submissions
- **RulesCommand**: Displays rules from file
- **StaffCommands**: All staff management commands in one class

Each command:
1. Checks permissions
2. Validates arguments
3. Performs database operations
4. Sends formatted responses
5. Handles errors gracefully

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Report
```
/report griefing Someone destroyed my house at spawn
```

### Anonymous Report
```
/report -anon hacking Player123 is using fly hacks in PvP
```

### Categorized Report
```
/report toxicity PlayerX was being very rude in chat
```

### Staff Workflow
```
/reports                    # Check unread reports
/reportview 5              # View details of report #5
/reporttp 5                # Teleport to report location
/reportread 5              # Mark as read
/reportassign 5 ModName    # Assign to staff member
/reportclear 5             # Close the report
```

## üîó Integration

### LuckPerms Setup
```
/lp group mod permission set picraft.report.view true
/lp group mod permission set picraft.report.read true
/lp group admin permission set picraft.* true
```

### DiscordSRV Setup
1. Install DiscordSRV
2. Set `discord.enabled: true` in config
3. Add your Discord channel ID
4. Optionally add role ID for mentions

### CoreProtect Integration
This plugin works alongside CoreProtect:
- Use reports to identify issues
- Use CoreProtect to investigate and rollback
- Perfect combination for server moderation

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes
